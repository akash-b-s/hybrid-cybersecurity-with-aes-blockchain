## 📁 Project Files

- `MAIN_CODE.m`: Main script to run the manual mode of the system
- `Auto_FInal_Code.m`: Automates the system operation
- `Final_code_Manual.m`: Manual version of the final implementation
- `AES.m`, `aesEncrypt.m`, `aesDecrypt.m`: Functions for AES encryption/decryption
- `xgboost_model.m`, `xgboost_model.mat`: Model and script for XGBoost-based predictions
- `Final_design.fig`, `Final_design.m`: GUI layout and callbacks
- `system_log.txt`, `system_logauto.txt`: Logs for system activities
- `DataHash.m`: Utility for generating hash of input data
- `decrypt_log.m`: Decryption and logging mechanism

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- MATLAB (GUI, Scripts, Machine Learning, AES Encryption)
- XGBoost Model (integrated in MATLAB)
- Secure Data Handling and Logging

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open MATLAB
2. Load `Final_design.fig` and run `Final_design.m` to launch the GUI.
3. Alternatively, use `MAIN_CODE.m` or `Auto_FInal_Code.m` for command-based execution.
4. Ensure the XGBoost model file `xgboost_model.mat` is present in the project directory.

## 🔐 Security Features

- AES Encryption & Decryption
- Hash-based Data Integrity
- System Logging for Auditing

## 📦 Installation

No special installation required. Ensure all `.m` files and `.mat` files are in the same working directory.
