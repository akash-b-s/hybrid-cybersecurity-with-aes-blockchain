Rules for communication
=======================
1. When a node generates a new block, it broadcasts it to the network
2. When a node connects to a new peer it querys for the latest block
3. When a node encounters a block that has an index larger than the current 
   known block, it either adds the block the its current chain or querys 
   for the full blockchain.
