Step-By-Step Instructions
=========================
- How to run the blockchain demo
 
1. Start two MATLAB instances
2. In both navigate to the demo folder and invoke runapp.m
   Both should now show the MATLAB Blockchain GUI
   Note that all outputs will be in the MATLAB command window
3. Press start button in both apps
4. In one of the apps press Add Client and wait until you get
   an error (*** Node not replying). This is ok.
5. In the other app switch the remote and local port numbers
   That means typing 8844 in the Remote port edit box and
   8866 in the Local port box. Then press Add Client button
   in the same app.
 
The two nodes should now be aware of each other and exchange
any changes to its blockchain.
 
6. In one of the apps type something in the Data edit box
   and press Mine Block. Wait until it is done.
7. Press Print Blockchain in the other app, the new block
   should now be replicated here.
 
The app will output '.' in the command window when the app is 
online and running. When mining 'x' are also added to the output.
 
If you try to add a block that isn't mined and thus has a hash
without proof-of-work (no zeros in the beginning), you can see that
the other node, or app, is rejecting it. If the other now mines
a new block now it will be rejected by the one with the with
a block with incorrect hash as the new chain is shorter. If you
now mine another block in the app without the faulty block,
that chain will be longer and replace the chain with the
faulty block (they reach consensus).
 
You can add more clients but you need to use the same procedure
as above were all other clients need to try to connect with
proper remote and local port numbers, and timeout. Then start
the new client and add all other clients with remote
and local port set. Note that you don't need to connect all 
other nodes. The network can be random.
